The Creata-SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang.
It is being used to build Creata, the first implementation of the Creata Hub.

**WARNING**: The SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making some
breaking changes.

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.15+](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Quick Start

To learn how the SDK works from a high-level perspective, go to the `SDK Intro`.

If you want to get started quickly and learn how to build on top of the SDK, please follow the SDK Application Tutorial. You can also fork the tutorial's repository to get started building your own `Creata SDK application`.

For more, please go to the `Creata SDK Docs`.

## Creata Hub Mainnet

The Creata Hub application, `creata`, has moved to its own repository. Go there to join the Creata Hub mainnet and more.
